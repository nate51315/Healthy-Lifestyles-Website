  <h2>Taking Good Health For Granted</h2>
  <p>An unhealthy lifestyle means more illness and more expense to treat those illnesses. When having poor health, this means less time at work, and less time spent on yourself, and a shorter lifespan. In modern day, people have a mindset that takes good health for granted. One can suffer from years of aches and pains, and would just ignore them, and then feel so surprised when one finds out one has developed a serious chronic disease. Majority of people will let their health be handled by doctors, rely on medical technology and drugs for when they feel ill. We have the choice to live a healthy lifestyle, but many chose to live just for today, enjoy life, and most of the time end up suffering in pain with chronic diseases or illnesses.</p>

  <h2>Unhealthy Lifestyle</h2>
  <p>There are many factors that add to the degrading of health among people today. Today we live in a world full of pollution. We are all exposed to thousands of toxins and chemicals every day at work, home, in the air, the food that we eat and the water that we drink. In addition, we consume more processed foods than ever, and we constantly abuse or bodies with medications. In this generation, we are tempted by fast food chains at every corner. Many teens spend lots of time doing indoor activities and not getting physically active. Because of this, there exists a generation that is out-of-shape, overweight and obese. Many spend too much time with other things and forget to watch over their overall well-being.</p>
  <h2>Life is Full of Stress</h2>
  <p>Life is full of struggles, deadlines, frustrations, and demands. Work can be a stressful place, whether in an office, a factory, or at school. For many people, stress is so common that it becomes a way of life. Stress is not always bad until there is too much. Some stress is good, it can help you perform under pressure and increase your focus. But when you are under too much stress; constantly rushing in panic mode, your mind and body pay the price. The diagram to the right shows how stress can effect your body. Click the link below the image on the right to read more about stress.</p>
  <h2>Healthy Aging</h2>
  <p>There are some diseases that become more common as we age. However, getting older does not automatically mean poor health or that you will be confined to a walker or wheelchair. Plenty of older adults enjoy vigorous health, often better than many younger people. Preventive measures like healthy eating, exercising, and managing stress can help reduce the risk of chronic disease or injuries later in life.

  <h2>Disease Prevention</h2>
  <p>The body relies on the nutrients it gets from food to keep it running smoothly and in good health. In today's society, the abundance of overprocessed, high-calorie, low-nutrient foods is responsible for a range of illnesses and diseases. Although a lack of food and nutrition is commonly associated with poor diet-related illnesses, overconsumption is just as much of a problem.<br><br><a href="dieting.html">Click to learn more about nutrition and how it prevents serious diseases</a></p>
  <h3>Coronary Heart Disease</h3>
  <p>Coronary heart disease is a narrowing of the blood vessels that carry oxygen and blood to the heart. People who eat too much animal fat, especially saturated fat, are at risk of coronary heart disease, as consuming too much fat causes the excess to block the passageways of blood and oxygen to the heart.</p>
  <h3>High Blood Pressure</h3>
  <p>Blood pressure is a measure of the force of blood produced by the heart as well as the condition of the arteries. When an individual has high blood pressure, undue stress and strain is being placed upon the heart to enable it to pump blood throughout the body. Foods that are high in sodium and saturated fats, as well as a lack of adequate hydration in the diet, can all lead to high blood pressure.</p>
  <h3>Type Two Diabetes</h3>
  <p>Type two diabetes is a disorder in which the blood has too much glucose in it that the body cannot process. Diabetes is often caused by diets that are too high in calories and sugar.</p>
  <h3>Cancer</h3>
  <p>Because poor nutrition causes the immune system to be weakened, a poor diet can often prohibit the body from fighting off certain types of cancers. Those individuals who do not get enough vitamins and nutrients in their food are at risk of cancer caused by immune deficiency.</p>
  <h3>Obesity</h3>
  <p>Obesity is a common problem in today's society of inactivity and poor diets. Foods that are high in sugar and saturated fats lead to obesity, which can open the door to a number of other diseases including heart problems and diabetes.</p>
