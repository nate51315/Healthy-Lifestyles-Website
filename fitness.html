  <h2>Fitness</h2>
  <p>It's never too late to get active and start improving your overall health. If exercising just isn't for you, then do it for your body, because it needs some attention! Any time is a good time to begin your journey on improving your very own well-being. This certainly does not mean you are required to train at an intense level for a year to get results. A casual walk with the dog or playing your favorite sport can have health benefits you never knew of. Start today to better yourself for tomorrow and get active.</p>
  <h2>Four Main Exercises</h2>
  <ol>
<li><h3> Endurance </h3>
<p id="olp">Commonly known as aerobic, endurance activities increase your breathing and heart rate. They keep your heart, lungs, and circulatory system healthy and improve your overall fitness. Building your endurance makes it easier to carry out many of your everyday activities.</p></li>
<li><h3>Strength</h3>
<p>This type of exercise will make your muscles stronger. They are also referred to as strength training or resistance training. Doing this type of exercise can make a big difference in your ability to stay independent. Everyday activities like climbing stairs or carrying groceries will be easier than before.</p></li>
<li><h3>Flexibility</h3>
<p>This exercise stretches your muscles and can help your body stay limber. Being flexible gives you more freedom of movement for other exercises as well as for your everyday activities.</p></li>
<li><h3>Balance</h3>
<p>Balance exercises help prevent falls, which is common for older adults. By training your lower-body strength, this will improve your balance and stability.</p></li>
