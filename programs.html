<h2>Program</h2>
<p>Getting motivated to start an exercise or dieting program is sometimes very difficult. There are countless reasons to start a program and an equal amount of reasons to not. The key is to strive for a better overall health. With that in mind, you can always keep that thought in your head to keep you moving. Every day you serve a purpose and each second counts either for or against you. Itâ€™s time for you to decide on whether starting a healthy lifestyle begins today. Every hour and day counts, and the clock is ticking.</p>
<h2>Five Step Exercise Program</h2>
<h3>Assess your fitness level</h3>
<p>Recording a baseline fitness score can give your benchmarks to compare to your future progress.
</p>
<h3>Design your fitness program</h3>
<p>Start with a simple plan to map out your fitness program.
</p>
<h3>Assemble your equipment</h3>
<p>Get the gear you need and want to begin every exercise. Try out equipment at a fitness center before buying so you can get the feel of what you may need.
</p>
<h3>Get started</h3>
<p>It's time to strap up those boots and start your first day of the journey. Stay focused and always give yourself time to warm up and stretch. </p>
<h3>Monitor your progress</h3>
<p>
Retake your personal fitness assessment six weeks after you start your program and then again every few months. Your may notice some increase or nothing, but keeping at it will only help you in the long run.
