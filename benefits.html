<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Eating a proper diet every day is an essential component of overall health. A good diet will provide you with the fuel your body needs to function on a daily basis and consistently eating a proper diet will afford many long-term benefits. Enjoy living smarter, healthier, happier and longer by making your diet all that it can be.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Eating Healthy</h2>
<h3>Live Smarter</h3>
<p>Brain health and cognition decrease with age. A proper diet can have the long-term benefits of preventing Alzheimer’s disease and increasing brain health as we age, thus improving things such as remembering, thinking and feeling. According to the Alzheimer’s Association: “Research suggests that high cholesterol may contribute to stroke and brain cell damage. A low fat, low cholesterol diet is advisable. And there is growing evidence that a diet rich in dark vegetables and fruits, which contain antioxidants, may help protect brain cells.”</p>
<h3>Live Healthier</h3>
<p>Common diseases affected long-term by poor diet include heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and cancer. A proper balanced diet of fiber, protein, dairy and fresh fruits and vegetables will help prevent many diseases and illness. Maintaining ideal weight is important as well. Eat in moderation -- too much or too little of any one food group will not provide a good balance of nutrients.</p>
<h3>Live Happier</h3>
<p>Eating foods that improve brain health such as omega-3 fats, which are found in seafood, and eating organic foods, which are treated with agricultural chemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, can contribute to long-term happiness. According to Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, Dr. Drew Ramsey, in Huffpost Healthy Living, “Emerging research in the fields of neuroscience and nutrition show that people who eat a diet of modern processed foods have increased levels of depression, anxiety, mood swings, hyperactivity, and a wide variety of other mental and emotional problems”</p>
<h3>Live Longer</h3>
<p>Prevention of disease that leads to early death and maintaining good brain health by eating a proper diet contributes to longevity and an increased quality of life. Foods to help you live longer such as fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains contain antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, which battle free radicals thought to contribute to aging. Some foods such as grapefruit interact with medications and allergic reactions to seafood are common. So, consult your healthcare provider about potential medication-food interactions and allergies before adding new foods to your diet.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Exercising</h2>
<h3>Control Weight</h3>
<p> Both diet and physical activity play a critical role in controlling your weight. You gain weight when the calories you burn, including those burned during physical activity, are less than the calories you eat or drink.</p>
<h3>Reduce Risk of Cardiovascular Disease</h3>
<p> Getting at least 150 minutes a week (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity can put you at a lower risk for these diseases. You can reduce your risk even further with more physical activity. Regular physical activity can also lower your blood pressure and improve your cholesterol levels.</p>
<h3>Reduce Risk of Type Two Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome</h3>
<p>Regular physical activity can reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a condition in which you have some combination of too much fat around the waist, high blood pressure, low HDL cholesterol, high triglycerides, or high blood sugar. Research shows that lower rates of these conditions are seen with 120 to 150 minutes (2 hours to 2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of at least moderate-intensity aerobic activity. And the more physical activity you do, the lower your risk will be.</p>
